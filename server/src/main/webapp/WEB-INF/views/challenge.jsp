                    The objective of this challenge is to implement a bot that can outplay other bots in

                    This challenge will be in a tournament style. When it is time for a tournament, all interested players
                    connect and join the room TOURNAMENT.
                    An administrator starts the tournament manually and depending on how many players have joined
                    (max 11 players per table) a suitable amount of tables are started, and players are placed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whenever a table has 3 or fewer players left all tables are stopped, and the
                    remaining players will shuffle and place into new tables to even the odds and keep
                    the game balanced.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Upon that time that only 11 players or less are remaining in play,
                    all tables will combine into one table. Showdown time!
                </p>

                    The ultimate winner of a tournament is the last standing player. The tournament keeps track of
                    when a player becomes bankrupt and uses this timestamp for establishing the total rank between
                    players (i.e., the earlier a player is bankrupt, the lower the score).
